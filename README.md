## Two common types of algorithms:

### Classification
The value of our labels belong to a discrete dataset.

Examples:
1) Based on how many hours a student studied for an exam, did they PASS or FAIL? --> PASS/FAIL
2) Based on the content of this email, is it SPAM or NOT SPAM? --> SPAM/NOT SPAM
3) Based on where a basketball player shot from, did he SCORE or NOT SCORE? --> SCORE/NOT SCORE
(Each case has two discrete possibilities)

### Regression
The value of our labels belong to a continuous set.

Examples:
1) Based on the year, make, and model of a car, what is its value? --> $0 - $50k
2) Based on an individual's daily caloric intake and minutes spent exercising, what is their weight? --> 80 - 400lb
